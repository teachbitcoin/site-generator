All scheduled class sessions spend more than half the time for hands-on `protocol coding examples and exercises` which the learners must complete, since the direct interaction with the protocol and Bitcoin network is where most of the learning takes place.

For a preview to the topics covered, have a look at the actual class presentations listed below.
