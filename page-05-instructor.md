James is a contributor to [Libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system), a c++ Bitcoin developer toolkit focused on readability, performance and scalability. He is a technical writer who has documented much of the library and regularly volunteers his time to educate the public about the internal Libbitcoin libraries at Bitcoin meetups and conferences.

James learned Bitcoin by carefully studying several hundred thousand lines of c++ Libbitcoin implementation code.

You can find his recent talks [here](../talks/).

Prior to Bitcoin, James led a data-science team at a Swiss e-commerce startup, co-founded a solar-simulation company and worked as an EDL (Entry Descent and Landing) aerospace engineer at the NASA Jet-Propulsion-Laboratory.
