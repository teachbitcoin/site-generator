title: Protocol Training
---
Studying the Bitcoin protocol design beyond the basics is hard for even the most motivated learners, as much of the protocol is hidden deep in the implementation source code.

Teach Bitcoin protocol training is an in-depth program that was inspired from the study of several hundred thousand lines of implementation code. It  teaches you both the high and low-level designs of the **Bitcoin Protocol**, so you can greatly accelerate your journey to becoming a Bitcoin implementation developer or protocol researcher.
